									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>I am a Christ follower first, a parent second, and a lover of learning third. I have a passion for ministry and a wide set of hobbies and skills that allow me to be flexible and creative in sharing the Gospel. I value my time in Children's Ministry as well as my time parenting my 5 year old son, Austin.</p>

								<h2>A Christ follower first</h2>
								<p>
									I found God when I was 20 years old, after I had already had a child and begun raising him on my own. 
									I spent the next few years trying to forgive myself and others for things in my past while also growing in my Faith and stepping into Children's Ministry. 
									It took me a while to warm up to it, but now I know that my future is in Ministry. 
									I can no longer see a world in which I am not spreading the Gospel. 
									I have a long testimony, and I'm still living it and growing in it. 
									I try to bring my love of Christ into everything I do, no matter how small.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Austin.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>A parent second</h2>
								<p>
									Austin is the brightest bundle of energy I have ever encountered. 
									Parenting him has its challenges, but with those also comes the abundance of love, joy, charisma, and magnetism he carries. 
									He's the only child I know who can walk up to someone who has never liked kids and have them drawn into a full-on game within seconds. 
									To say that he's a blessing would be an understatement. 
									I did have him when I was young, and that has come with its own share of challenges but, I like to say that we're growing up together. 
									To this day I'm convinced he teaches me more life lessons than I teach him. But, despite any challenge that comes our way, I will always love being his mom. 
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/learning.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>A lover of learning third</h2>
								<p>
									For a long time I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. 
									To this day I keep changing my mind in pursuit of one career field. 
									I've come to the conclusion that if I could make a career out of continually learning new things I would in a heartbeat. 
									Until I find a way to make that happen, I will continue working side projects to help me learn more every day. 
									If you have any suggestions as to what I should learn, PLEASE send them my way! I'm always looking for new things to learn.
								</p>

								<a href="http://fat-broke-and-lazy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" class="image main"><img src="images/Me Austin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									Although writing is something I was absolutely gifted with, if I'm being honest, I don't do it often enough.
									Between working, parenting, serving, and adulthood, writing tends to fall to the bottom of my to-do list. 
									That being said, I do genuinely enjoy writing, especially when it becomes therapeutic. 
									I have a long testimony, and I'm sure I could spend years sharing bits and pieces of my journey. 
									So, while I don't promise consistency, I do have a blog in which I share pieces of my testimony in hopes of inspiring others with my struggles and triumphs. 
									I cover things from my life as an athiest and finding a relationship with God to solo parenting and how it's affected different areas of my life. 
									I look forward to continuing to share my testimony and spread hope, love, and truth.
